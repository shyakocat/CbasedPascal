# CbasedPascal
A toy C preprocessor with Pascal style.<br>
<br>
<br>
Our teacher checked our C code to vanish similiar ones.<br>
I was unluckily under suspicion. But obviously I didn't copy any code from others or websites.<br>
So I write a tiny file which let me be able to write Pascal-like code in C.<br>
I think now nobody will write something similiar to mine.<br>
<br>
<br>
It works when solving simple OI/ACM problems.<br>
